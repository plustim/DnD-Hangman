# DnD Hangman

[Play Hangman!](https://plustim.github.io/DnD-Hangman/)  
A simple JavaScript game in which you try to guess letters in a word with a limited number of wrong guesses.  I've selected D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) as a theme because I'm that much of a nerd, but you could easily change the ui to suit any theme, and the "wordlist" variable on line 7 of game.js to include whatever words you want. (Dungeons and Dragons is of course a registered trademark of Wizards of the Coast LLC).
